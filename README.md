# Lyrics-Search-Engine
This project was developed as part of the Data Mining course at the University of Peloponnese. The objective of the project is to design and implement software capable of storing and searching for songs using an inverted index. The application was developed within a Docker container, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment for development and deployment across different systems. This approach facilitates cross-platform compatibility and streamlines the management of dependencies, making the software more robust and portable.
