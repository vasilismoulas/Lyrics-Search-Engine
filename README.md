# Lyrics-Search-Engine
The objective of the project is to design and implement software capable of storing and searching for songs using an inverted index. The application was developed within a Docker container, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment for development and deployment across different systems. This approach facilitates cross-platform compatibility and streamlines the management of dependencies, making the software more robust and portable.
